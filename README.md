Before building an Ansible Tower (AWX) implementation for a customer, it's crucial to gather requirements to ensure a smooth deployment and alignment with their infrastructure and automation needs. Here are key questions to ask:

1. Business & Use Case Requirements
What are your primary use cases for Ansible Tower? (e.g., configuration management, application deployment, patching, security compliance, etc.)
What problems are you trying to solve with Ansible Tower?
What are the key business goals for implementing automation?

3. Infrastructure & Environment
What operating systems and distributions do you need to manage? (e.g., RHEL, Ubuntu, Windows, etc.)
What cloud providers or on-prem infrastructure do you use? (AWS, Azure, GCP, VMware, bare metal, etc.)
How many servers/nodes will Ansible Tower manage?
Are you using containers or Kubernetes? Do you need Ansible Tower to integrate with them?

5. Security & Compliance
Do you have security policies that Ansible Tower must adhere to? (e.g., RBAC, encrypted credentials)
What authentication mechanisms do you use? (LDAP, Active Directory, SAML, OAuth)
Do you require Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access to playbooks and inventories?
Will there be privileged operations requiring integration with vaults (e.g., CyberArk, HashiCorp Vault)?

how to setup database for Red Hat Ansible Tower. What is the best database option? MariaDB or PostGresD

Setting Up the Database for Red Hat Ansible Tower (AWX)
Ansible Tower requires PostgreSQL as its database backend. MariaDB is not supported. Below is the best practice for setting up PostgreSQL for Ansible Tower.

1️⃣ Best Database Option for Ansible Tower

✅ PostgreSQL is the only supported database for Ansible Tower.

Why PostgreSQL?
Officially recommended and required by Red Hat.
Optimized for handling JSON, structured data, and complex queries.
Supports Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) effectively.
Scales well with large workloads.
Better support for concurrent connections compared to MariaDB.
2️⃣ Database Installation & Configuration

🔹 Option 1: Use Embedded PostgreSQL (Simple Setup)
If you're deploying Ansible Tower on a single node, the Tower installer automatically installs PostgreSQL.
This is fine for small environments but not recommended for production.
🔹 Option 2: Use an External PostgreSQL Server (Recommended for Production)
For scalability, security, and performance, it's best to use an external PostgreSQL database.

Step 1: Install PostgreSQL on an External Server

sudo yum install -y postgresql-server postgresql-contrib
Step 2: Initialize the Database

sudo postgresql-setup initdb
Step 3: Configure PostgreSQL for Remote Access

Open the PostgreSQL config file:
sudo vi /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf
Edit the listen_addresses to allow remote connections:
listen_addresses = '*'
Open pg_hba.conf:
sudo vi /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf
Add this line to allow connections from Ansible Tower’s server:
host all all 192.168.1.0/24 md5
(Replace 192.168.1.0/24 with your Ansible Tower subnet)
Step 4: Restart and Enable PostgreSQL

sudo systemctl restart postgresql
sudo systemctl enable postgresql
Step 5: Create a Database and User for Ansible Tower

Login to PostgreSQL:
sudo -i -u postgres psql
Run the following commands:
CREATE DATABASE awx;
CREATE USER awxuser WITH PASSWORD 'securepassword';
ALTER ROLE awxuser SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
ALTER ROLE awxuser SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';
ALTER ROLE awxuser SET timezone TO 'UTC';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE awx TO awxuser;
Step 6: Update Ansible Tower Configuration

Modify /etc/tower/conf.d/postgres.py with the external database details:
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'awx',
        'USER': 'awxuser',
        'PASSWORD': 'securepassword',
        'HOST': '192.168.1.10',  # Change to your PostgreSQL server IP
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
Step 7: Restart Ansible Tower

sudo ansible-tower-service restart
3️⃣ PostgreSQL Performance Tuning for Ansible Tower

For large-scale deployments, tune your database for optimal performance.

Enable Connection Pooling (Recommended)
sudo yum install -y pgbouncer
Configure /etc/pgbouncer/pgbouncer.ini:

[databases]
awx = host=127.0.0.1 port=5432 dbname=awx

[pgbouncer]
listen_port = 6432
listen_addr = *
auth_type = md5
auth_file = /etc/pgbouncer/userlist.txt
max_client_conn = 100
Increase Max Connections Edit postgresql.conf:
max_connections = 200
shared_buffers = 512MB
work_mem = 16MB
4️⃣ Database Backup and Maintenance

Regular backups ensure data integrity and recovery.

Schedule Daily Backups
pg_dump -U awxuser -h 192.168.1.10 -d awx -F c > /backup/awx_$(date +%F).dump
Enable Auto-Vacuum Edit postgresql.conf:
autovacuum = on
5️⃣ Key Takeaways

✔ Use PostgreSQL, as it is the only supported database.
✔ Use an external PostgreSQL server for better performance and security.
✔ Tune PostgreSQL settings for high availability and performance.
✔ Implement regular backups to prevent data loss.
